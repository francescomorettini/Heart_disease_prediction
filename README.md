# Heart disease prediction

Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) develops when main arteries become clogged and start to harden and narrow and is a major cause of death and disability in developed countries [1]. Untreated CHD may result in patients developing Heart Failure.

We analyzed a dataset of patient subjected to coronary angiogram (CA) to assess the presence of CHD. Our goal was to check if there are some risk factors and, since patients are distributed in four different countries, if there is variability between countries. We found that a large ST elevation and the presence of angina during physical activity are linked to presence of CHD. We also found that there is variability between countries and, investigating deeper, this seems to be caused by the fact that in some countries CA is performed only if patients experience chest pain.

In addition, we analyzed a dataset of patients that suffer from Heart Failure (HF) that allowed us to perform survival analysis and classification, which highlights the presence of some risk factors like age and high blood pressure that, in literature, are correlated to the risk factors of the previous analysis.
